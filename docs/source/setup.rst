Setting up dddm
===================
For most practical purposes, one can simply run `pip install dddm` to install it via https://pypi.org/project/dddm/.

For some implementations (MultiNest), one is adviced to follow instructions as on this script:

That said, as ultranest is an implemented and working alternative method to MultiNest, a pip setup may prove much simpler.
